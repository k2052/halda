How is are layout algorithim for the Firehose going to work?
Hottee items should be the biggest.

Hottest item should take on full width of the grid.

No more than 10 items day.
Entirely a full width layout.

Bookmarks die after 10 days

AND HERE IS THE THING MOVE BACK INTO THE FIREHOSE

Things you liked eventually show back up but they don't nag on your mind if you don't get to them

We fear losing good things so we never clear our lists of bookmarks.
But what if we didn't have to worry.

if something decays

we need to parse twitter likes and facebook likes and add them to the temp
no pagination for the items. just 10 items. never anymore. to get something new you have to bookmark say nah to something
tap pulls of social links. swipe to kill it.

hover for links

there will be three functions;

1. save for later (popups collection)
2. never show again
3. maybe show again in the future (maybe just a slide to decrease temp)

items will have fulld width if an article of image.
we will puull excerpts long enough no matter what.
for github we will pull the raw README and then format.

clicking save for later fills the area with grid of collections.
collections have an image and a title little descripion. count of items in it. like github explore grid items
collection image can be set but defaults to first item and if there is no item to a nice pattern image sourced
from subtle patterns or something
